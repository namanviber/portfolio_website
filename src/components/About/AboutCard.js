            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Naman Jain </span>

            <br />
            <br />

            I have a strong background in mobile and web application development
            using the Flutter and React frameworks, as well as proficiency in
            C++ and Python, with a focus on generative AI, deep learning, and
            machine learning. Apart from coding, I possess exemplary strategic
            thinking and problem-solving skills to help projects succeed. A
            collaborative team player recognised for routinely producing
            high-quality applications.
            <br />

            Apart from my technological skills, I enjoy engaging in a variety of
            other activities!

          <ul>
            <li className="about-activity">
              <ImPointRight /> I'm fascinated by the historical conflicts,
              political actions, and transformations in society that shaped the
              world we live in.
            </li>
            <li className="about-activity">
              <ImPointRight /> I like to explore a variety of news sources and

              When I'm not doing any other stuff, you can find me eliminating
